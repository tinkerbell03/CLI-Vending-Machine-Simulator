This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) based vending machine simulation developed in C++. The application provides core vending machine functionalities, including:

    Displaying available items: Users can view a list of products currently in stock.

    Taking orders: Users can select items and specify quantities.

    Calculating and printing the bill: The system generates a detailed bill for the selected items.

    Finalizing transactions: Handles the completion of the purchase process.

Designed for ease of use and clarity, this project serves as a practical example of fundamental C++ programming concepts applied to a real-world scenario. It's a great starting point for understanding basic input/output operations, data structures, and procedural logic in C++.
